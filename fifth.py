# Create a SpaceX class.
# it should take 1 parameter in its constructor: the stored fuel
#
# it should have 4 methods:
#
# addRocket(rocket)
# it should add a new rocket to SpaceX that is given in its first parameter
# use the rockets from the fourth exercise.
#
# refill_all()
# it should refill all of its rockets with fuel and substract the needed fuel from the storage
#
# launch_all()
# it should launch all the rockets
#
# buy_fuel(amount)
# it should increase stored fuel by amount
#
# getStats()
# it should return its stats as a sting like: "rockets: 3, fuel: 100, launches: 1"
